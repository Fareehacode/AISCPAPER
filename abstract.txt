Over the past ten years, the rate of systematic materials discovery has accelerated. Studies that systematically examine  different  families  of  materials  with  the  intention  of finding  existing materials  with  unknown  qualities  or  developing  new  materials  with  desired  properties  are multiplying at a startling rate. In terms of computation, molecular simulations have become more sophisticated, enabling researchers  to  predict  the  structure  and  characteristics  of  complex materials  even  before  they  are  ever  created.  High-throughput screening methods  can  be  used with  chemical  characteristics  prediction  to  aid  in  the  discovery  of  novel  materials.  Due to  their promising capacities to extract and make use of data-driven information, applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning techniques in the field of materials science are becoming more widespread. Given the composition of the material, we use predictive models for a range of material attributes to help with this procedure. Multiple databases are used to compile the input  data  necessary  to  train  the  machine  learning  model.  Once trained,  it  can  be  used  to apply predictions for various input data.
